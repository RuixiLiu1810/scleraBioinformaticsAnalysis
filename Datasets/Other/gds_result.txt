(Submitter supplied) Differentiation of neural retina in organoid cultures from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is highly variable and requires an extended period of as many as 200 days. To provide objective assessment of different protocols and culture conditions, we performed transcriptome analysis and molecular staging using RNA-seq data from developing and adult human retina. Using a modified protocol with 9-cis retinal (9CRAL) instead of widely-used all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the culture media, we show comparable differentiation of human embryonic and induced PSCs into a polarized, laminated architecture with all retinal cell types in retinal organoids. more...

(Submitter supplied) The growth orientation of the Marchantia polymorpha thallus – a system of dorsiventralized, indeterminate axes – is modulated by light. We show that red and blue light act antagonistically to control thallus flatness, with red light signalling promoting epinasty and blue light signalling promoting hyponasty. We found that loss-of-function mutations in the blue light receptor MpPHOT led to epinasty, while loss-of-function mutations in the red light receptor MpPHY resulted in hyponasty. more...

34. Cryptochromes interact directly with PIFs to control plant growth in limiting blue light
(Submitter supplied) Sun-loving plants have the ability to detect and avoid shading through sensing of both blue and red light wavelengths. Higher plant cryptochromes (CRYs) control how plants modulate growth in response to changes in blue light. For growth under a canopy, where blue light is diminished, CRY1 and CRY2 perceive this change and respond by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5. These factors are also known to be controlled by phytochromes, the red/far-red photoreceptors; however, transcriptome analyses indicate that the gene regulatory programs induced by the different light wavelengths are distinct. Our results indicate that CRYs signal by modulating PIF activity genome-wide, and that these factors integrate binding of different plant photoreceptors to facilitate growth changes under different light conditions.

39. Neurogenomic  signatures of successes and failures in core life-history transitions in a key insect pollinator
(Submitter supplied) The switch between biological states during key life-history transitions requires major reprogramming at the behavioural level that is under the control of the brain. In this study we focused on major life-history transitions in bumblebee queens (Bombus terrestris) that involve switching from virgin to mated and reproductively mature. To reveal the molecular processes underpinning the behavioural changes that accompany these transitions, we characterised the neurogenomic state of queens that succeeded or failed in making these transitions. more...

40. PIF4/HEMERA-mediated daytime thermosensory growth requires the Mediator subunit MED14
(Submitter supplied) Warm ambient temperatures do not trigger stress responses in plants but stimulate the growth of specific organs. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) plays a central role in regulating thermomorphogenetic hypocotyl elongation in various plant species, including the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Although it is well known that PIF4 promotes plant thermosensory growth by activating key genes involved in the biosynthesis and signaling of the phytohormone auxin, the detailed molecular mechanism of such transcriptional activation is still not clear. more...

43. MicroRNA156 conditions auxin sensitivity to enable growth plasticity in response to environmental changes in Arabidopsis (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play diverse roles in plant development, but whether and how miRNAs participate in thermomorphogenesis remains ambiguous. Here we show that HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) – a key component of microRNA biogenesis – acts downstream of the thermal regulator PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 in temperature-dependent plasticity of hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis. A hyl1-2 suppressor screen identified a dominant dicer-like1 (dcl1) allele, dcl1-24, that rescues hyl1-2’s defects in miRNA biosynthesis and warm temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Light initiates the seedling deetiolation transition by promoting major changes in gene expression mainly regulated by phytochrome (phy) photoreceptors. During the initial dark-to-light transition, phy photoactivation induces rapid changes in gene expression that eventually lead to the photomorphogenic development. Recent reports indicate that this process is achieved by phy-induced degradation of Phy-Interacting bHLH transcription Factors (PIFs) PIF1, PIF3 PIF4 and PIF5, which are partly redundant constitutive repressors of photomorphogenesis that accumulate in darkness. more...

48. Auxin signaling in the epidermis regulates stem growth via interactions with the brassinosteroid pathway
(Submitter supplied) Growth of a complex multicellular organism requires coordinated changes in diverse cell types.  These cellular changes generate organs of the correct size, shape and functionality.  During plant development, the growth hormone auxin induces stem elongation; however, which cell types of the stem perceive the auxin signal and contribute to organ growth is poorly understood.  Here, we show that auxin signalling is required in many cell types for correct hypocotyl stem growth, with a key role for the epidermis. more...

74. MicroRNA156 conditions auxin sensitivity to enable growth plasticity in response to environmental changes in Arabidopsis (miRNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play diverse roles in plant development, but whether and how miRNAs participate in thermomorphogenesis remains ambiguous. Here we show that HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) – a key component of microRNA biogenesis – acts downstream of the thermal regulator PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 in temperature-dependent plasticity of hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis. A hyl1-2 suppressor screen identified a dominant dicer-like1 (dcl1) allele, dcl1-24, which rescues hyl1-2’s defects in miRNA biosynthesis and warm temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation. more...

90. Cryptochromes interact directly with PIFs to control plant growth in limiting blue light
(Submitter supplied) Sun-loving plants have the ability to detect and avoid shading through sensing of both blue and red light wavelengths. Higher plant cryptochromes (CRYs) control how plants modulate growth in response to changes in blue light. For growth under a canopy, where blue light is diminished, CRY1 and CRY2 perceive this change and respond by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5. These factors are also known to be controlled by phytochromes, the red/far-red photoreceptors; however, transcriptome analyses indicate that the gene regulatory programs induced by the different light wavelengths are distinct. Our results indicate that CRYs signal by modulating PIF activity genome-wide, and that these factors integrate binding of different plant photoreceptors to facilitate growth changes under different light conditions.

107. Analysis of gene expression controlled by light and brassinosteroids
(Submitter supplied) Plant photomorphogenesis and skotomorphogenesis depend on interplay of various plant hormones. Brassinosteroids (BRs) play crucial roles during hypocotyl establishment both in the light and darkness. Arabidopsis brassinosteroid insensitive1 (bri1-5) is a partial loss-of-function mutant, and the short-hypocotyl phenotype of bri1-5 is greatly suppressed by a long-hypocotyl mutant phytochrome B (pbyB-77) at the double mutant for the two in the light conditions to display additive phenotypes of both. more...

In this study, D. salina was exposed to red (660 nm) and blue light (450 nm), and cell growth, pigments, and transcriptome were analyzed. The RNA of D. salina was sequenced and transcriptomic response of algal cells after transitioning from white light to red and blue light was investigated. Genes encoding for enzymes involved in photosynthesis were down-regulated, whereas genes involved in the metabolism of carotenoid were up-regulated. Genes encoding for photoprotective enzymes related to reactive oxygen species scavenging were up-regulated under both red and blue light. The present transcriptomic study would assist in the comprehensive understanding of carotenoid biosynthesis of D. salina.

The Arabidopsis thaliana pif quadruple mutant (pifQ), which lacks four PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs), is agravitropic in the dark. Endodermis-specific expression of PIF1 rescues gravitropism in pifQ mutant seedlings.

143. Preventing light-induced toxicity in a new mouse model of sector retinitis pigmentosa caused by Rhodopsin M39R variant
(Submitter supplied) Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by the progressive loss of rod photoreceptors. Sector RP is a form of RP, where degeneration originates in the inferior retina, mainly influenced by light exposure. Over 200 RHO variants are pathogenic and associated with autosomal dominant RP. RHOM39R is one of the most common RHO variants linked to sector RP in the UK. A knock-in (KI) mouse model expressing RhoM39R was generated and characterized to investigate the mechanisms of degeneration associated with this variant and explore novel therapeutic strategies for rhodopsin sector RP. more...

158. Gene expression in the rcb (regulator for chloroplast biogenesis) mutant in red light conditions
(Submitter supplied) The regulator for chloroplast biogenesis (rcb) mutant was identified as a mutant defective in phytochrome-mediated chloroplast biogenesis. The rcb mutant has long hypocotyl and albino phenotypes. RCB initiates chloroplast biogenesis in the nucleus by promoting the degradation of the master repressors for chloroplast biogenesis, the PIFs (Phytochrome Interacting Factors). To understand how RCB regulates the expression of PIF-regulated genes, we performed genome-wide expression analysis of RCB-dependent genes using a rcb-10 null allele.

184. The Arabidopsis Zinc Finger Protein 3 integrates ABA and light signaling in seed germination and plant development
(Submitter supplied) ZFP3, a nuclear C2H2 zinc finger protein acts as a negative regulator of ABA- suppressed germination. Regulated over-expression of ZFP3 and closely related ZFP1, ZFP4, ZFP6 and ZFP7 confers ABA insensitivity to seed germination while the zfp3,zfp4 double mutant displays enhanced ABA susceptibility. Reduced expression of a large set of ABA-induced genes such as RAB18 and transcription factors ABI3, ABI4, ABI5 and RGL2 in ZFP3ox seedling suggests that ZFP3 indeed negatively regulates ABA signaling. more...
