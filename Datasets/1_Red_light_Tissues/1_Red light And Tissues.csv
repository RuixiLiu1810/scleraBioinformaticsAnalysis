GSE233440,Mapping the daily rhythmic transcriptome in the diabetic retina,"Retinal function changes dramatically from day to night. Yet, clinical diagnosis, treatments, and experimental sampling occur during the day, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of the pathobiology occurring at night. While there is evidence that diabetes disrupts the circadian system that optimizes our physiology to the environmental light/dark cycle, the impact of such disruption is not well understood. This study investigates whether diabetes affects the retina's daily rhythm of gene expression to understand the pathobiology of diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes. Control and hyperglycemic littermate mice (Ins2Akita/J) were kept under a standard 12h:12h light/dark cycle until four months of age.  Bulk mRNA sequencing was conducted in retinas collected every 4 hours throughout the 24 hr light/dark cycle. Computational approaches were used to detect rhythmicity, predict acrophase, identify differential rhythmic patterns, analyze phase set enrichment, and predict upstream regulators. The retinal transcriptome exhibited a tightly regulated rhythmic expression with a clear 12-hr axis of transcriptional rush, peaking at midday and midnight. The functions of day-peaking genes were enriched for DNA repair, RNA splicing, and ribosomal protein synthesis, whereas night-peaking genes were enriched for metabolic processes and growth factor signaling. Although the 12-hr transcriptional axis is retained in the diabetic retina, it was phase advanced by approximately 1-3 hours with a wider distribution. Upstream regulator analysis for the genes that showed phase shifts identified oxygen sensing mechanisms and HIF1alpha as regulators, but not the circadian clock, which remained in phase to the light/dark cycle. We propose a model in which early in diabetes, the diabetic retina experiences a 鈥榡et lag鈥 caused by the entrained circadian clock and its output being in one phase and metabolic pathways related to neuronal dysfunction and hypoxia driving advancement of gene expression to a different phase. Further studies are now required to evaluate the chronic implications of such internal jet lag for development of diabetic retinopathy.","Control and hyperglycemic C57BL/6-Ins2Akita/J (Ins2Akita) mice were selected randomly at four months of age, and euthanized at one of six time-points over a 24hour light/dark cycle (ZT: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 where ZT0 is indicative of lights on and ZT12 lights off), with 4-5 biological replicates for each time-point",38039846
GSE216645,Identification of fibrotinflammatory and fibrotic transcriptomic subsets of human sclerotic cutaneous chronic graft-versus-host disease,"Cutaneous sclerotic chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a common and highly morbid complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We identified genes that are significantly upregulated in the skin of sclerotic cGVHD patients (n = 17) compared to HSCT patients without sclerotic cGVHD (n = 9) by bulk RNA sequencing. This revealed two transcriptomic groups of affected patients: those with fibrotic and inflammatory/Th1 gene expression, the fibroinflammatory group, and those with predominantly fibrotic/TGF飦-associated expression, the fibrotic group. This transcriptomic heterogeneity was also associated with histopathologic heterogeneity, with the fibroinflammatory sub-cluster showing more histopathologic features of epidermal cGVHD and inflammation. Further study will help elucidate if these gene expression and histopathologic findings can be used to tailor treatment decisions. Multiple highly induced genes in the skin (SFRP4, SERPINE2, COMP) were also found to be significantly induced in sclerotic cGVHD patient plasma (n = 16) compared to control HSCT patients without sclerotic cGVHD (n = 17), suggesting these TGF飦 and Wnt pathway mediators as candidate blood biomarkers of disease.",Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of bulk RNA-seq data from human skin of hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (HSCT) with chronic sclerotic graft-versus-host disease compared to HSCT patients without chronic sclerotic graft-versus-host disease.,38357212
GSE168749,"Transcriptional profiles of cone cells, rod cells, and pineal photoreceptor cells in zebrafish","For isolation of rod, cone, and pineal photoreceptor cells, we used the transgenic zebrafish lines, Tg(rho:egfp)ja2Tg, Tg(gnat2:egfp)ja23Tg, and Tg(exorh:EGFP)ja1Tg, which express EGFP in rods, all cone subtypes, and pineal rod cells, respectively. Retinas were dissected from dark-adapted adult fish under dim red light. The isolated retinas were digested with trypsin in Ca2+-free Ringer鈥檚 solution. The reaction was terminated by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor and fetal bovine serum. The dissociated EGFP-positive cells were isolated with a fluorescence activating cell sorter (FACSAria, BD Biosciences) by the following three parameters: forward scatter, side scatter and green fluorescence. Goal was to determine differentially expressed genes among three types of photoreceptor cells.","Three-condition experiment: cone, rod, and pineal cells.

GSE304732,Preventing light-induced toxicity in a new mouse model of sector retinitis pigmentosa caused by Rhodopsin M39R variant,"Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by the progressive loss of rod photoreceptors. Sector RP is a form of RP, where degeneration originates in the inferior retina, mainly influenced by light exposure. Over 200 RHO variants are pathogenic and associated with autosomal dominant RP. RHOM39R is one of the most common RHO variants linked to sector RP in the UK. A knock-in (KI) mouse model expressing RhoM39R was generated and characterized to investigate the mechanisms of degeneration associated with this variant and explore novel therapeutic strategies for rhodopsin sector RP. Under cyclic ambient light, RhoM39R/+ KI mice exhibited impaired retinal function by ERG, with some defects in OS ultrastructure, but retained normal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness. Repeated exposure to bright light led to photoreceptor loss. In contrast, RhoM39R/M39R KI mice in cyclic ambient light displayed severe retinal dysfunction, ONL thinning, and grossly abnormal OS ultra structure. In homozygous mice, a single bright light exposure significantly reduced ONL thickness within 48 h. The rescue of these models was achieved through reduced light exposure and pharmacological intervention. Rearing in dim red light (red cage condition) restored ERG responses in RhoM39R/+ KI mice and improved ONL thickness in RhoM39R/M39R KI mice. Transcriptomic analysis in RhoM39R/M39R KI mice revealed upregulation of Sphingosine 1-P Receptor (S1pr) transcripts. Treatment with the S1PR agonist Fingolimod (FTY720) before bright light exposure significantly reduced degeneration, demonstrating a protective effect in both heterozygous and homozygous models and suggesting potential a therapeutic approach for sector RP patients.",We compared gene expression of 3 weeks old Rho+/+ and RhoM39R/M39R mice,41120272
GSE129104,Transcriptome-based molecular staging of human stem cell-derived retinal organoids uncovers accelerated photoreceptor differentiation by 9-cis retinal,"Differentiation of neural retina in organoid cultures from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is highly variable and requires an extended period of as many as 200 days. To provide objective assessment of different protocols and culture conditions, we performed transcriptome analysis and molecular staging using RNA-seq data from developing and adult human retina. Using a modified protocol with 9-cis retinal (9CRAL) instead of widely-used all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the culture media, we show comparable differentiation of human embryonic and induced PSCs into a polarized, laminated architecture with all retinal cell types in retinal organoids. Transcriptome comparisons of multiple developing organoids to that of human fetal and adult retina have permitted molecular staging of the differentiation state and uncovered expedited rod photoreceptor maturation by 9CRAL. A direct comparison with the ATRA-organoid cultures revealed higher expression of rhodopsin and other rod genes in 9CRAL-organoids. Our studies thus provide a framework for transcriptome-based staging of retinal organoids to facilitate advances in human disease modeling and evaluation of therapies.","Five cell lines, one ESC line (H9) and four iPSC lines (PEN8E, PEN8E_2, NEI377 and ESP) were cultured across two different institutions and four researchers. Samples were harvested at various time points during differentiation. Differentiation of H9, PENE8E, PENE8E_2, and NEI377-derived organoids followed similar protocols. ESP-derived organoids were differentiated via previously published protocols. Starting at day (D)63, H9 and PEN8E media was supplemented with 9-cis retinal (9CRAL), whereas PEN8E_2, NEI377 and ESP were supplemented with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). In addition, H9 experiments were performed a second time and direct comparisons performed at D90 and D120 with either ATRA or 9CRAL.",31814692
GSE143396,Circadian analysis of the mouse retinal pigment epithelium transcriptome,"Purpose: The presence of a phagocytic peak of photoreceptor outer segments by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) one or  two hours after the onset of light has been reported for several diurnal and nocturnal species. This peak in phagocytic  activity also persists under constant lighting conditions (i.e., constant light or dark) thus demonstrating that the timing  of this peak is driven by a circadian clock. The aim of this study was to investigate the change in RPE whole  transcriptome at two different circadian times (CT; 1 hour before (CT23) and 1 hour after (CT1) subjective light onset)",Retinal pigment epithelium enriched samples isolated from whole eyes from 8-10 week old male C57BL/6J mice at 2 different circadian timepoints in triplicate,32105725
GSE24625,Transcriptome in 129sv and Crx-/- pineal gland at ZT (Zeitgeber time) 6 and ZT20,"The cone-rod homeobox gene (Crx) encodes Crx, a transcription factor selectively expressed in two cell types, retinal photoreceptors and the melatonin secreting pinealocytes of the pineal gland. In this report the role of Crx in regulating gene expression in the mammalian pineal gland was extended using Affymetrix GeneChip technology. Deletion of Crx results in broad modulation of the mouse pineal transcriptome, including a >2-fold downregulation of 543 genes and a >2-fold upregulation of 745 genes. In addition to Crx, there was a >10-fold downregulation of 13 other genes. Of special interest was the discovery of a link between Crx and the homeobox gene Hoxc4, which was upregulated ~20-fold in the Crx-/- pineal gland. Analysis of night and day expression of genes indicated that a set of 51 genes exhibited differential expression in control animals.",Pineal glands from control (129sv) mice and Crx-/- mice were collected at ZT6 and ZT20 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix mouse 430_2 chip. Each condition were performed as triplicats.,21797868
