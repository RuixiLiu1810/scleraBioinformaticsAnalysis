GSE284642,Effect of form derivation on mouse retinal transcriptome,"The underlying molecular mechanisms resulting in myopia development are unknown. Here, we employed a mouse model of experimental myopia, inducing form-deprivation myopia using a diffuser goggle. We then analysed retinal transcriptome of form-deprived retinas and contralateral control retinas with RNA sequencing.","Three male C57BL/6J mice were housed in a standard 12-12 hour light-dark cycle.From postnatal day (P) 28, mice were exposed to form-deprivation myopia (FDM) by surgically attaching a head-mounted diffuser goggle over the right eye. The left eye remained uncovered and served as an internal control. Refractive error, corneal curvature and axial length were measured at P28, P35, and P42. Myopic shift was confirmed in the goggled eye. Retinal tissue was collected at P42, RNA was extracted and mRNA levels analyzed using RNA-Seq.",39876870
GSE90118,Expression analysis of chicken chorioretinal tissues in control and myopic eyes with or without violet light,"To find the possible molecular mechanism of myopia protection by violet light, we performed expression microarray analysis of chick chorioretinal tissue. The mRNA were obtained at day 13 from the following four groups: control eyes with or without violet light exposure and covered eyes with or without violet light exposure, and then the gene expression pattern was compared among them. Principle component analysis, which is to find major patterns of variability in gene expression, was performed and we found that the largest gene population (PC1, positive: n = 138, negative: n = 292) was affected by violet light treatment. On the other hand, the second largest gene population (PC2, positive: n = 120, negative: n = 23) was affected in the eyes covered with a plastic lens. The previously reported myopia-related genes such as Bmp2, Ednrb, Fgf2, Igf1, Il18, Irbp, Lumican, Sfrp1, Tgfb1, Vegfa, Vip, and Wnt2b were not found in the PC1 group in vivo, which indicates that they responded less to violet light. In the PC1 group, only one myopia protective gene, EGR1 (ZENK, zif268), was found among the previously reported myopia related genes.","Sixteen eyeballs of eight chicks from the two experiment groups were divided into four subgroups: violet-/control, violet+/control, violet-/covered, violet+/covered. Total RNA of the four eyeballs in each subgroup were extracted and mixed. Total RNA was analyzed using Chicken (V2 026441) Gene Expression Microarray 4 x 44K (Agilent 153 Technologies, California, USA).",28063778

GSE97125,Proteolytic processing of LRP2 on RPE cells regulates BMP activity to control eye size and refractive error,"We compare dissected ocular tissues from wild-type and lrp2-/- mutant adult zebrafish in order to examine the genetic pathways underlying the enlarged eye phenotype observed in the absence of Lrp2. ABSTRACT: Mutations in LRP2, a transmembrane receptor, cause ocular enlargement and high-myopia. LRP2 is expressed by the RPE and eye ciliary epithelia, binding many extracellular ligands, including Bmp4 and Shh. Signaling mediated by LRP2 is very context-dependent, and how multiple pathways are coordinated is unknown. Transcriptome analyses of ocular tissues revealed that controlled, sustained BMP signaling from the RPE is critical for normal eye growth and emmetropia (proper refraction). Using human iPSC-derived RPE, and zebrafish, we demonstrate that BACE sheddase-dependent LRP2 cleavage produces a soluble domain that binds BMP4, inhibiting its signaling. We propose that controlled proteolytic cleavage of LRP2 makes two ligand-binding receptor forms available: a soluble BMP trap, and a membrane-bound RPE signaling facilitator. By modulating LRP2 cleavage, cells can fine-tune and coordinate multiple signaling pathways. This data supports the concept that LRP2 acts as a homeostasis node that buffers and integrates diverse signaling to regulate emmetropic eye growth.","Examination of whole eyes, sclera/choroid, RPE and retina in wild-type and lrp2-/- mutant zebrafish at 1 month post-fertilization.",
GSE6543,Chick myopia,"One-day old white Leghorn chicks were housed in brooders with a 12 hr light:dark cycle, using General Electric chroma 50 fluorescent lighting with irradiance of approximately 50渭W/cm2 at chick eye level. They received Purina Chick Chow food and water ad libitum. At one week of age and at the onset of the light phase, the chicks were anesthetized with inhalation ether, and a unilateral translucent white plastic goggle was glued to the periorbital feathers to induce ipsilateral form-deprivation myopia, alternating between the left or right eye.","Six biological replicates used for each: 3 day control retina, 3 day experimental, 6 hour control retina, and 6 hour experimental.","17652709,20363242"
GSE16974,Retinal gene expression in Egr-1 knock-out mice during development (p30 and p42),"In chicks, the avian homologue of the early growth response protein-1 (ZENK) has been shown to be increased in a special cell type of the retina, the glucagonergic amacrine cells, under conditions that lead to a reduction in eye growth (myopic defocus, recovery of myopia) and decreased under conditions that enhance ocular growth (hyperopic defocus, form-deprivation). The investigation of Egr-1 knock-out mice showed that homozygous knock-out mice with no functional Egr-1 protein developed relative axial myopia at the age of 42 and 56 days, compared to heterozygous- and wildtype Egr-1 knock-out mice.",Retinal samples of young homozygous Egr-1 knock-out and wildtype mice at the age of 30 days (hm30 and wt30; no difference in axial eye length yet) and 42 days (hm42 and wt42; already a difference in axial eye length of 59 碌m) were taken to compare the mRNA expression changes over time between these two genotypes and within the same genotype between the two age groups.,20019881
GSE235684,Single Cell Transcriptomics Identifies Distinct Choroid Cell Populations Involved in Visually Guided Eye Growth,"Postnatal ocular growth is regulated by a vision-dependent mechanism, termed emmetropization, which acts to minimize refractive error through coordinated growth of the ocular tissues. Many studies suggest that the ocular choroid participates in the emmetropization process via the production of scleral growth regulators that control ocular elongation and refractive development.   To elucidate the role of the choroid in emmetropization, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the cell populations in the chick choroid and compare gene expression changes in these cell populations during conditions in which the eye is undergoing emmetropization. UMAP clustering analysis identified 24 distinct cell clusters in all chick choroids. 7 clusters were identified as fibroblast subpopulations; 5 clusters represented different populations of endothelial cells; 4 clusters were CD45+ macrophages, T cells and B cells; 3 clusters were Schwann cell subpopulations; and 2 clusters were identified as melanocytes. Additionally, single populations of RBCs, plasma cells and neuronal cells were identified.  Significant changes in gene expression between control and treated choroids were identified in 17 cell clusters, representing 95% of total choroidal cells. The majority of significant gene expression changes were relatively small (< 2 fold). The highest changes in gene expression were identified in a rare cell population (0.11% - 0.49% of total choroidal cells). This cell population expressed high levels of neuron-specific genes as well as several opsin genes suggestive of a rare neuronal cell population that is potentially light sensitive. Our results, for the first time, provide a comprehensive profile of the major choroidal cell types and their gene expression changes during the process of emmetropization as well as insights into the canonical pathways and upstream regulators that coordinate postnatal ocular growth.","To investigate the gene expression changes in choroidal cell populations during the process of emmetropization, we isolated cells from choroid tissue digests of choroids isolated from chick eyes recovering from form deprivation myopia and contralateral control eyes. Following FACS sorting of live cells, live cells were processed for sc-RNA sequencing.  Comparative gene expression profiling analyses were performed for three samples of choroidal cell populations from control eyes and three sets of choroidal cell populations from recovering eyes.",38390290
GSE203619,Genome-wide analysis of gene regulatory networks in chickens reveals dynamic temporal changes in retinal signaling cascade underlying compensation to lens-imposed optical defocus [control],"During postnatal development, the optical geometry of the eye is refined through a process called emmetropization. During eye emmetropization, positive optical defocus inhibits eye growth whereas negative optical defocus accelerates it. Increased exposure to negative optical defocus leads to the development of myopia. Although several studies investigated gene regulatory networks underlying retinal response to optical defocus, temporal changes that occur during ocular response to optical defocus are poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the retinal gene regulatory networks underlying optical-defocus-induced myopia using massive parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in chickens exposed to negative optical defocus for 1, 3 and 6 days. Our analysis revealed large-scale dynamic temporal changes in the retinal signaling pathways involved in the eye鈥檚 response to negative optical defocus. We found that different sets of pathways and biological functions were involved in the early, sustained and delayed response to optical defocus causing myopia. These data refine signaling pathways that can be targeted for myopia control and provide a framework for the development of new treatment options for myopia.",Analysis of mRNA expression in the retina of a control group of chickens during a 6 day period,
