GSE46435,Scleral miRNA profiles in adult and fetal eyes,"Introduction: In human eyes, ocular enlargement/ growth, reflects active scleral extracellular matrix remodeling. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by base pairing with target sequences, and serve as nodes of signaling networks. We hypothesized that the sclera, like most tissues, expresses miRNAs, some of which modulate genes regulating ocular growth. In this study, the scleral miRNA expression profile of rapidly growing human fetal eyes was compared with that of stable adult donor eyes using high-throughput microarray and quantitative PCR analyses.  Results: Human sclera expressed several miRNAs. Microarray comparison of adult and fetal samples revealed many to be differentially expressed (p<0.01, min p= 6.5x10^11), with increased expression of collagen specific mir-214, let-7c, let-7e, mir-103, mir-107, and mir-98 in fetal sclera subsequently confirmed (1.5 to 4 fold changes, p<0.01). For both adult and fetal samples, no significant differences in miRNA expression profiles of sclera from posterior and peripheral ocular regions were observed.   Conclusion: This is the first study to catalogue miRNA expression in human sclera. The sclera expresses several miRNAs, some of which show age-related differential regulation, higher in rapidly growing fetal eyes, consistent with a role in ocular growth regulation. These findings may be useful for linking scleral miRNA expression with potential manipulation in disorders such as scleral ectasia/ axial myopia.","Scleral samples from normal human fetal (24 wk) and normal adult donor eyes (n=4 to 6, each group) were obtained, and RNA extracted. Genome-wide miRNA profiling was performed using the Agilent miRNA microarray platform. miRNA target predictions were obtained using Microcosm, TargetScan and PicTar algorithms.",24205357
GSE200049,Genome-wide analysis of microRNA-mRNA gene regulatory networks reveals widespread involvement of microRNAs in visually guided eye emmetropization and myopia [miRNA sclera],"During postnatal development, the optical geometry of the eye is refined through a process called emmetropization. During eye emmetropization, optical defocus triggers a signaling cascade that originates in the retina, propagates across other ocular tissues and results in scleral wall remodeling. This signaling is associated with large-scale changes in gene expression, which was extensively studied at the mRNA level. Although several studies investigated the role of non-coding RNAs in eye emmetropization, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs remains poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide analysis of the miRNA-mRNA gene regulatory networks underlying optical-defocus-induced myopia using massive parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our analysis revealed a widespread involvement of miRNAs in optical defocus perception and visually guided eye emmetropization underlying myopia development. We found that a relatively small number of miRNAs (39 miRNAs total) regulate expression of over 450 mRNAs, or 59% of all mRNAs differentially expressed in the eyes of mice with optical-defocus-induced myopia.

We proposed to examine the function and underlying mechanisms of miR-204-5p in myopia development. Methods: The miR-204-5p expression level was assessed in the vitreous humor (VH) of a cohort consisting of 11 patients with high myopia (HM) and 16 control patients undergoing retinal surgery. The functional implications of miR-204-5p in ARPE-19 cells were assessed, encompassing cell aggressiveness. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) was found as a possible target of miR-204-5p through mRNA sequencing, and its interaction with miR-204-5p was confirmed employing luciferase assay and western blotting. Furthermore, the miR-204-5p function in regulating oxidative stress was examined by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Results: miR-204-5p was found to be significantly reduced in the VH of HM patients. Overexpression of miR-204-5p suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in ARPE-19 cells. The bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that miR-204-5p can modulate the genes associated with pathways relevant to myopia, including glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation, lysosome, and TGF鈭抌eta signaling pathway. The direct targeting of miR-204-5p on TXNIP has been confirmed through validation, and its downregulation mediated the miR-204-5p impacts on ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, miR-204-5p overexpression significantly reduced ROS accumulation by targeting TXNIP. Conclusion: Our findings revealed the possible contribution of the miR-204-5p/TXNIP axis in myopia development by regulating oxidative stress, which may provide new targets and novel therapeutic strategies to combat this prevalent and debilitating condition.","To investigate the possible target of miR-204-5p, we established ARPE-19 cell lines transfected with miR-204-5p or miR-NC.",

Excessive exposure to negative optical defocus often leads to the development of myopia. However, it is still largely unknown how optical defocus is detected by the retina. Here, we used genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to conduct analysis of the retinal genetic networks underlying contrast perception and refractive eye development. We report that the genetic network subserving contrast perception plays an important role in optical defocus detection and emmetropization. Our results demonstrate an interaction between contrast perception, the retinal circadian clock pathway and the signaling pathway underlying optical defocus detection. We also observe that the relative majority of genes causing human myopia are involved in the processing of optical defocus. Together, our results support the hypothesis that optical defocus is perceived by the retina using contrast as a proxy and provide new insights into molecular signaling underlying refractive eye development.","Analysis of RNA expression in the retina of 129S1/svlmj, A/J, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ mice",

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) serves vital roles in ocular development and retinal homeostasis. We interrogated the genetics of gene expression of cultured human fetal RPE (fRPE) cells under two metabolic conditions. Genes with disproportionately high fRPE expression are enriched for genes related to inherited ocular diseases. Variants near these fRPE-selective genes explain a larger fraction of risk for both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and myopia than variants near genes enriched in 53 non-ocular human tissues. Increased mitochondrial oxidation of glutamine by fRPE promoted expression of lipid synthesis genes implicated in AMD. Expression and splice quantitative trait loci (e/sQTLs) analyses revealed shared and metabolic condition-specific loci of each type and several eQTLs not previously described in any tissue. Fine mapping of fRPE e/sQTLs across AMD and myopia genome-wide association data suggests new candidate genes, and mechanisms by which the same common variant of RDH5 contributes to both increased AMD risk and decreased myopia risk. Our study highlights the unique transcriptomic characteristics of fRPE and provides a resource to connect e/sQTLs in a critical ocular cell type to monogenic and complex eye disorders.",Examination of 24 fRPE cell lines under glucose and galactose metabolic conditions,31123710

GSE3300,Form deprivation modulates retinal neurogenesis in primate experimental myopia,"Juvenile primates develop myopia when their visual experience is degraded by lid fusion. In response to the abnormal visual input, retinal neural networks cause an excessive growth of the postequatorial segment of the eye, but the mechanism underlying this axial elongation is unknown. By combining analysis of gene expression, injection of the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and immunocytochemistry, we show that the retinal periphery in both juvenile rhesus macaques and green monkeys harbors a population of mitotically active neuroprogenitor cells that proliferate when the visual experience is altered by lid fusion. Furthermore, the number of dividing cells is highly correlated with the axial elongation of the eye and the resulting myopic refractive error. Thus, the retina undergoes active growth during the postnatal development of the primate eye. This growth is modulated by the visual input and accelerates considerably when the eye develops axial myopia.","cDNA subtractions, construction of cDNA libraries and differential screening were performed as previously described (Tkatchenko et al, 2000). Two subtractions were carried out resulting in two cDNA libraries. One library was enriched in clones potentially up-regulated in the retina of the closed eye and the other was enriched in cDNAs potentially down-regulated. One thousand clones from each library were analyzed, and 535 differentially-expressed cDNAs were amplified by PCR and spotted onto glass slides coated with poly-L-lysine (five duplicates for each cDNA). The slides were then processed, hybridized with Cy3- and Cy5-labeled complex cDNA probes and washed in 0.2xSSC as described at http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/protocols/.

ABSTRACT: Mutations in LRP2, a transmembrane receptor, cause ocular enlargement and high-myopia. LRP2 is expressed by the RPE and eye ciliary epithelia, binding many extracellular ligands, including Bmp4 and Shh. Signaling mediated by LRP2 is very context-dependent, and how multiple pathways are coordinated is unknown. Transcriptome analyses of ocular tissues revealed that controlled, sustained BMP signaling from the RPE is critical for normal eye growth and emmetropia (proper refraction). Using human iPSC-derived RPE, and zebrafish, we demonstrate that BACE sheddase-dependent LRP2 cleavage produces a soluble domain that binds BMP4, inhibiting its signaling. We propose that controlled proteolytic cleavage of LRP2 makes two ligand-binding receptor forms available: a soluble BMP trap, and a membrane-bound RPE signaling facilitator. By modulating LRP2 cleavage, cells can fine-tune and coordinate multiple signaling pathways. This data supports the concept that LRP2 acts as a homeostasis node that buffers and integrates diverse signaling to regulate emmetropic eye growth.","Examination of whole eyes, sclera/choroid, RPE and retina in wild-type and lrp2-/- mutant zebrafish at 1 month post-fertilization.",

GSE235684,Single Cell Transcriptomics Identifies Distinct Choroid Cell Populations Involved in Visually Guided Eye Growth,"Postnatal ocular growth is regulated by a vision-dependent mechanism, termed emmetropization, which acts to minimize refractive error through coordinated growth of the ocular tissues. Many studies suggest that the ocular choroid participates in the emmetropization process via the production of scleral growth regulators that control ocular elongation and refractive development.   To elucidate the role of the choroid in emmetropization, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the cell populations in the chick choroid and compare gene expression changes in these cell populations during conditions in which the eye is undergoing emmetropization. UMAP clustering analysis identified 24 distinct cell clusters in all chick choroids. 7 clusters were identified as fibroblast subpopulations; 5 clusters represented different populations of endothelial cells; 4 clusters were CD45+ macrophages, T cells and B cells; 3 clusters were Schwann cell subpopulations; and 2 clusters were identified as melanocytes. Additionally, single populations of RBCs, plasma cells and neuronal cells were identified.  Significant changes in gene expression between control and treated choroids were identified in 17 cell clusters, representing 95% of total choroidal cells. The majority of significant gene expression changes were relatively small (< 2 fold). The highest changes in gene expression were identified in a rare cell population (0.11% - 0.49% of total choroidal cells). This cell population expressed high levels of neuron-specific genes as well as several opsin genes suggestive of a rare neuronal cell population that is potentially light sensitive.

In the PC1 group, only one myopia protective gene, EGR1 (ZENK, zif268), was found among the previously reported myopia related genes.","Sixteen eyeballs of eight chicks from the two experiment groups were divided into four subgroups: violet-/control, violet+/control, violet-/covered, violet+/covered. Total RNA of the four eyeballs in each subgroup were extracted and mixed. Total RNA was analyzed using Chicken (V2 026441) Gene Expression Microarray 4 x 44K (Agilent 153 Technologies, California, USA).",28063778
GSE200048,Genome-wide analysis of microRNA-mRNA gene regulatory networks reveals widespread involvement of microRNAs in visually guided eye emmetropization and myopia [miRNA retina],"During postnatal development, the optical geometry of the eye is refined through a process called emmetropization. During eye emmetropization, optical defocus triggers a signaling cascade that originates in the retina, propagates across other ocular tissues and results in scleral wall remodeling. This signaling is associated with large-scale changes in gene expression, which was extensively studied at the mRNA level. Although several studies investigated the role of non-coding RNAs in eye emmetropization, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs remains poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide analysis of the miRNA-mRNA gene regulatory networks underlying optical-defocus-induced myopia using massive parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our analysis revealed a widespread involvement of miRNAs in optical defocus perception and visually guided eye emmetropization underlying myopia development. We found that a relatively small number of miRNAs (39 miRNAs total) regulate expression of over 450 mRNAs, or 59% of all mRNAs differentially expressed in the eyes of mice with optical-defocus-induced myopia.  MiRNAs were also found to be involved in the regulation of the absolute majority of the biological processes and signaling pathways underlying visually guided eye emmetropization and myopia.",Analysis of microRNA expression in the retina of C57BL/6J mice in which myopia was induced with -20D lenses for 10 days,
GSE58124,Evaluation of MicroRNA Expression Profiles for Form-Deprivation Myopia in Mouse,"The study aim was to determine microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of ocular tissues in form-deprivation induced myopia (FDM) mice. Form-deprivation myopia was induced in C57BL/6Jmice over the right eye; the contralateral left eyes were used as controls. Whole genome microRNA expression profiles in myopic whole eye, retina, and sclera were determined using the Agilent mouse miRNA microarray. The normalized microarray data were performed ANOVA test to identify differences in miRNA expression between myopic and control eyes. The differential expression for selected miRNAs was validated by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR).","Fifteen C57BL/6J mice were used in this study.  Form-deprivation myopia was induced over the right eyes; the contralateral left eyes were used as controls. Total RNA was isolated from the whole eye (6 mice), retina (9 mice), and sclera (9 mice) and was used for miRNA expression profiling with the Agilent Mouse miRNA v.15 Microarray.",
GSE16974,Retinal gene expression in Egr-1 knock-out mice during development (p30 and p42),"In chicks, the avian homologue of the early growth response protein-1 (ZENK) has been shown to be increased in a special cell type of the retina, the glucagonergic amacrine cells, under conditions that lead to a reduction in eye growth (myopic defocus, recovery of myopia) and decreased under conditions that enhance ocular growth (hyperopic defocus, form-deprivation). The investigation of Egr-1 knock-out mice showed that homozygous knock-out mice with no functional Egr-1 protein developed relative axial myopia at the age of 42 and 56 days, compared to heterozygous- and wildtype Egr-1 knock-out mice.",Retinal samples of young homozygous Egr-1 knock-out and wildtype mice at the age of 30 days (hm30 and wt30; no difference in axial eye length yet) and 42 days (hm42 and wt42; already a difference in axial eye length of 59 碌m) were taken to compare the mRNA expression changes over time between these two genotypes and within the same genotype between the two age groups.,20019881
GSE84220,Large-scale microRNA expression profiling identifies retinal miRNA-mRNA signaling pathways underlying form-deprivation myopia in mice,"Development of myopia is associated with large-scale changes in ocular tissue gene expression. Although differential expression of coding genes underlying development of myopia has been a subject of intense investigation, the role of non-coding genes such as microRNAs in the development of myopia is largely unknown. In this study, we explored myopia-associated miRNA expression profiles in the retina and sclera of C57Bl/6J mice with experimentally induced myopia using microarray technology. We found a total of 53 differentially expressed miRNAs in the retina and no differences in miRNA expression in the sclera of C57BL/6J mice after 10 days of visual form deprivation, which induced -6.93 卤 2.44 D (p < 0.000001, n = 12) of myopia. We also identified their putative mRNA targets among mRNAs found to be differentially expressed in myopic retina and potential signaling pathways involved in the development of form-deprivation myopia using miRNA-mRNA interaction network analysis. Analysis of myopia-associated signaling pathways revealed that myopic response to visual form deprivation in the retina is regulated by a small number of highly integrated signaling pathways. Our findings highlight substantial involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of refractive eye development, and in the development of myopia through the retinal gene regulation.","Differential expression of microRNAs was analyzed in the retina and sclera of C57BL/6J mice after 10 days of visual form deprivation. Visual form deprivation was carried out from P24 through P34. Three replicates were used per condition, i.e., myopia versus control.",27622715

GSE43516,Gene expression changes under cyclic mechanical stretch in rat retinal Muller cells,"The retina is often subjected to tractional forces in a variety of conditions, for instance, pathological myopia, proliferative vitreoretinopathy. As the predominant glial element in the sensory retina, Muller cells are responsible for the homeostatic and metabolic support of retinal neurons and active players in virtually all forms of retinal injury and disease. Besides, Muller cells span the entire retinal thickness, extending from the inner to the outer limiting membranes, with cell bodies located in the inner nuclear layer and lateral processes expanding into the plexiform layers of the tissue. Because of this unique morphology, Muller cells can sense even minute changes in the retinal structure because of the mechanical stretching of their long processes or side branches. Thus, it鈥檚 reasonable to infer that Muller cells also participate in ocular diseases when the retina is overstretched. In this study, we aim to investigate the whole genome regulation of Muller cells under mechanical stretching, which may help in excluding possible molecular mechanisms that would account for many retinal diseases in which the retina is often subjected to mechanical forces.","Rat Muller cells were seeded onto flexible bottom culture plates and subjected to a cyclic stretching regimen of 15% equibiaxial stretching for 1 and 24 h.Muller cells cultured under the same conditions but with no applied mechanical strain were considered as the unstretched control. At each time points (1 and 24 h), three totally independent experiments (3 stretched samples and 3 control samples) were conducted. Muller cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Stretch (S); Control (C)",23723984
GSE203555,Genome-wide analysis of gene regulatory networks in chickens reveals dynamic temporal changes in retinal signaling cascade underlying compensation to lens-imposed optical defocus [1d],"During postnatal development, the optical geometry of the eye is refined through a process called emmetropization. During eye emmetropization, positive optical defocus inhibits eye growth whereas negative optical defocus accelerates it. Increased exposure to negative optical defocus leads to the development of myopia. Although several studies investigated gene regulatory networks underlying retinal response to optical defocus, temporal changes that occur during ocular response to optical defocus are poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the retinal gene regulatory networks underlying optical-defocus-induced myopia using massive parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in chickens exposed to negative optical defocus for 1, 3 and 6 days. Our analysis revealed large-scale dynamic temporal changes in the retinal signaling pathways involved in the eye鈥檚 response to negative optical defocus. We found that different sets of pathways and biological functions were involved in the early, sustained and delayed response to optical defocus causing myopia. These data refine signaling pathways that can be targeted for myopia control and provide a framework for the development of new treatment options for myopia.",Analysis of mRNA expression in the retina of chickens in which myopia was induced with -10D lenses for 1 day,
GSE63225,G9a and ZNF644 physically associate to suppress progenitor gene expression during neurogenesis,"Proliferating progenitor cells undergo unidirectional changes in competence to give rise to post-mitotic progeny of specialized function. These transitions in cell fate typically involve the dynamic regulation of gene expression programs by histone methyltransferase (HMT) complexes. However, the composition, roles and regulation of these HMT complexes in regulating cell fate decisions in vivo are poorly understood. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we identified the uncharacterized C2H2-like zinc finger (ZF) protein ZNF644, which is putatively causally linked to high-grade (degenerative) myopia, as a novel G9a/GLP-interacting protein and co-regulator of histone methylation. Using zebrafish embryos, we characterized the function of two ZNF644 orthologues, znf644a and znf644b, revealing critical neural- specific roles in regulating G9a/H3K9me2-mediated gene silencing in the retina. In addition, by virtue of additional non-overlapping requirements for znf644a and znf644b during retinal differentiation, we gained further insights regarding additional facets of retinal differentiation regulated by the G9a-ZNF644 physical association, such as maintaining retinal cell viability and in transitioning proliferating progenitor cells towards differentiation. Collectively, our data points to the G9a-ZNF644 physical interaction as a critical neural progenitor-specific co-factor of G9a/H3K9me2-mediated gene silencing during neuronal differentiation.",Examination of histone modifications in 2 ZNF644a/b mutants versus wildtype.,27546533
GSE53411,"Gene profiling studies in postnatal Mfrprd6 mutant eyes reveal differential expression of Prss56, a trypsin-like serine protease, and genes involved in visual and phototransduction pathways.","Mutations in the membrane frizzled-related gene (Mfrp) are linked to posterior microphthalmia, retinitis pigmentosa and nanophthalmia in humans. In homozygous Mfrprd6 mice, a splice site mutation causes a slow photoreceptor degeneration characterized by shortening and disorganization of outer segments with eventual photoreceptor loss.  To better understand the function of MFRP in the retina, microarray analysis was carried out in mutant and control mice at postnatal day14 (P14), prior to the loss of photoreceptors.  Analysis of the data revealed differentially expressed RPE and neuroretina transcripts.  Although the analysis of the microarray data from Mfrprd6 mutant mice compared to age-matched wild-type controls identified some transcripts with relative fold change > 5.0, most of the differentially expressed genes showed a relative fold change between1.5 - 2.0.  Global gene expression analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software identified decreased levels of transcripts in phototransduction and visual pathways in Mfrprd6 mutants. Select candidate transcripts were validated by quantitative real-time PCR analyses. The expression of RPE-specific visual transduction protein, RPE65, was significantly decreased in Mfrprd6 mutants. As an indirect consequence of the primary RPE cell defect due to the Mfrprd6 mutation, retinal specific transcripts Rgr, Pde6a, GuCa1b, and Rgs9 were also significantly decreased. We also confirmed the significantly elevated levels of Prss56, a gene previously associated with myopia and open angle glaucoma.  In the Mfrprd6 mutant, a progressive increase in Prss56 mRNA levels from 14- to 70-fold was observed from P7 to P21, respectively. In situ hybridization and glutamine synthetase staining of mutant eyes indirectly identified M眉ller glia in the inner nuclear layer of retina as the cell type expressing the Prss56 transcript.","This experiment had one model term, a combination of strain and time, which consisted of four levels (B6_P0, B6_P14, Rd6_P0 and Rd6_P14). Three biological replicates were used per term level. A total of 12 Affymetrix Mouse 430v2 Arrays were used in gene expression analysis.",25357075
